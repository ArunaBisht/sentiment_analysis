# Sentiment Analyzer

This startup is providing the more integrated platform combining public sentiment websites like Reddit, stock sites like Alpaca and trading platforms like Robinhood, so that an investor can get better unified insight into stocks before investing. The recent incident of Wall Street/ bet has onces again proved that public sentiments play a significant role in driving the market. Companies like AMC and Gamestop who were almost on the verge of bankruptcy were turned into multi-millionaire overnight just because few investors crazily pumped money into these stocks. 

Hence, our goal is to leverage public sentiments and feed that data into the ML model to quantify and predict overall market sentiments in order to make better decisions and then connect that to trading platforms to automate trades. We provide users better insight to the stocks and deeper analysis of public sentiments.

#Approach

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For data cleaning, preparation and manipulation

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications

* [Pyviz](https://pyviz.org/) - Python visualization package that provides a single platform for accessing multiple visualization libraries. Two of these libraries are Plotly Express and hvPlot, which were used in this project

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - A Python library which allows you to build a web application
